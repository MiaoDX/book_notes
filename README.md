## What or Why

I consider myself a `blog/github/tutorial - learning` guy, these are awesome and can help us have a nice glance of what the thing `behaves or looks like`, every now and then I think myself less organized or systemic and want to know what the things's `why` and `how` are.

So, I go back to some `classical` books and start a long and challenge journey. Great changes are that I will stop half way, it's still worth a new repo here. ^_^

Good luck and have fun.
