# Some nice descriptions in papers

* cope with/deal with/address the problem
* To relax this restriction, two linear solutions were presented in [18] and [1], with **respective** computational complexity O(n^5) and O(n^8).
  - Instead of using **respectively**, it uses **respective**.
* In this section, we experimentally investigate our optimal solution to the PnP problem, **referred to as** OPnP,
* Another conducted experiment **targets** the width of the network.
* We **approach the problem** by learning a similarity measure on small image patches using a convolutional neural network.
* Python is an object-oriented language with built-in facilities for making multiple inheritance tractable. However, it's better to avoid multiple inheritance **altogether**.
