Some of the nice description in papers.

* cope with/deal with/address the problem
* To relax this restriction, two linear solutions were presented in [18] and [1], with **respective** computational complexity O(n^5) and O(n^8).

Instead of using **respectively**, it uses **respective**.

* In this section, we experimentally investigate our optimal solution to the PnP problem, **referred to as** OPnP,

* Another conducted experiment targets the width of the network.
