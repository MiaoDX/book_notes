C12.Registration

homography


Registering images into mosaics gets more interesting when there are more than two images. Imagine we have three images, I_1, I_2, and I_3. Write T_{2→1} for the estimated transformation that takes image two into image one’s frame (and so on). The problem is that T_{2→1} ◦ T_{3→2} might not be a good estimate of T_{3→1} the transformation from image three’s frame to image one’s frame. We need some method to estimate all registrations in one go, using all error terms. Doing so is often called *bundle adjustment*.
