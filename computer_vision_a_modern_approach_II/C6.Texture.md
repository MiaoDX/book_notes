# Chapter 6. Texture

Three main kinds of texture representationï¼š

* Local texture representation
* Pooled texture representation
* Data-driven texture representation

## 6.1. Local texture representations using filters


## 6.4 Image Denoising

Liner filters such as Gaussian kernels are effective at suppressing noise, but cause loss in image detail.

Three related much more effective approaches, relay on natural images' two properties:

* prominence of *self-similarities*: many small regions in the same picture often look the same
* effectiveness of *sparse* liner models: small images patches are typically well reconstructed as a liner combination of very few elements from a potentially large basis set, or dictionary.


### 6.4.1 Non-local Means

> estimating the denoised pixel x[i] as a weighted average (the so-called Nadaraya-Watson estimator) of all the other pixels in the image

>The weights depend on appearance similarity instead of spatial proximity in the case of Gaussian smoothing, hence the name of non-local means.


### 6.4.2 Block Matching 3D (DM3D)
