# C4.Linear Filters

use weighted sums of pixel values using different patterns of weights to  smooth noise, find edges and other image patterns.


## 4.1 Linear filters and convolution

### Linear filters

$$\mathit{R_{ij}}=\frac{1}{(2k+1)^2}\sum_{u=i-k}^{i+k}\sum_{v=j-k}^{j+k}\mathit{F_{uv}}$$


* shift invariant:
meaning that the value of the output depends on the pattern in an image
neighborhood, rather than the position of the neighborhood
* linear:
meaning that the output for the sum of two images is the same as the sum of the outputs obtained for the images separately


### Symmetric Gaussian Kernel

$$\mathit{G_\sigma}(x,y)=\frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}exp(-\frac{(x^2+y^2)}{2\sigma^2})$$


## 4.2 shift invariant linear system

* Superposition

$$\mathit{R}(f+g)=\mathit{R}(f)+\mathit{R}(g)$$

* Scaling

$$R(kf)=kR(f)$$

* Shift invariance

the response to a translated stimulus is just a translation of the response to the stimulus


**The response of a shift invariant linear system to a stimulus is obtained by
convolution.**
