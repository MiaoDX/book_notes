# C3.Color

## Human Color Perception


## 3.3.Representing Color

### 3.3.2. Non-linear Color Spaces

Color terms:

Hue(色度): red->green
Saturation(饱和度): ref->pink
Brightness(lightness,value): black->white


## 3.5. Inference from color

* find specularities
* remove shadows
* infer surface color

### 3.5.1 Finding Specularities Using Color

Seems interesting



### Programming exercises

* 3.15. Build a specularity finder along the lines described in Section 3.5.1.
* 3.16. Build a shadow remover along the lines described in Section 3.5.2 (this is much easier than it sounds, and the results are usually rather good).
