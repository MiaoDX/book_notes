The *risk* function of a particular classification strategy is the expected loss when using that strategy, as a function of the kind of item.

$R(s)=p(-1\rightarrow1|using s)L(-1\rightarrow1)+p(1\rightarrow-1|using s)L(-1\rightarrow1)$

L(i\rightarrowj) means the Loss of an item of type i is classified as an item of type j.
