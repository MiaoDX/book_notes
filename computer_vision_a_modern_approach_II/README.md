I chose this book over some other alternatives because of the chapter arrangement is so irresistible and I even wrote a program to generate the mind map of the chapter of this book:

However, by far (eight chapter reading with tons of skip content), I do not think this book is very suitable for me: the theory parts, especially the matrices operations are really hard for me.

Each and every time I want to quit, the next chapter name stopped me to do so, well, I really appreciate the author's hardwork on the chapter names (and contents in them).  :( :)

Well, that's it. Maybe I will revisit these chapters after more matrices learning.
