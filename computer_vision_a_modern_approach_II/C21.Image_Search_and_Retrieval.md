## 21.2 BASIC TECHNOLOGIES FROM INFORMATION RETRIEVAL

* Word Counts
* TF-IDF term frequency-inverse document frequency

## 21.2.3 Approximate Nearest Neighbors and Hashing

For two documents with fixed length count vectors $c_1$ and $c_2$, a large value of cosine similarity implies a small value of $||c_1 âˆ’ c_2||^2$.

### Locality Sensitive Hashing

we build a set of hash tables containing the data items, using different hashing functions for each table. 

### KD-Trees for Approximate Nearest Neighbors
