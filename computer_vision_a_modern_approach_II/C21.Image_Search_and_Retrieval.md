C21. Image Search and Retrieval

## 21.2 BASIC TECHNOLOGIES FROM INFORMATION RETRIEVAL

* Word Counts
* TF-IDF term frequency-inverse document frequency

### 21.2.3 Approximate Nearest Neighbors and Hashing

For two documents with fixed length count vectors $c_1$ and $c_2$, a large value of cosine similarity implies a small value of $||c_1 âˆ’ c_2||^2$.

#### Locality Sensitive Hashing

we build a set of hash tables containing the data items, using different hashing functions for each table. 

#### KD-Trees for Approximate Nearest Neighbors


### 21.3 Images as documents

#### vector quantization

* visual words
* several different vector quantization
* extremely large vocabulary

#### interest points

* PCA-SIFT to describe points
* use affine transformation determine whether the image is a near duplicate

### 21.3.2 Ranking image search results

do not pile up all the very similar pictures all together, have some friendly ranking.

* a variant of pagerank.

### 21.3.4 Browsing the layout

* MDS multidimensional scaling

## 21.4 Predicting annotations for pictures
