# Chapter 8. Structure from Motion

Known:  the projections of n points have been matched across m pictures
Target: using this information to estimate
* the 3d positions of the points in some fixed coordinate system (*Structure*)
* the projection matrices associated with the cameras observing them (apparant *motion* of the cameras relative to the points)

## 8.1 INTERNALLY CALIBRATED PERSPECTIVE CAMERAS

$$p_{ij} = \frac{1}{Z_{ij}}\begin{pmatrix}R_i&t_i\end{pmatrix}\binom{P_j}{1}$$

Known: m pictures, n points $P_j(j=1,...,n)$, correspondences established

*Euclidean SfM* Problem: estimate n vectors $P_j$ + m rotation matrices $R_i$ + translation vectors $t_i$

Analysis: 2mn constraints <=> 6m extrinsic parameters of the matrices $\mathit{M_i}$ and 3n parameters of the vectors $P_j$

So, take into account ambiguity of this problem, it admits a finite number of solutions as soon as:

$$2mn\geq6m+3n-7$$

For m = 2, five point should be OKAY.

**QUESTION:** why `2mn`, why `-7`

### 8.1.2 Euclidean Structure and Motion from Two Images

* Weak Calibration

* From Essential Matrix to Camera Motion

Aka, Essential Matrix $\large\varepsilon$ -> $R$ and $t$

We can have four numerical solutions,

> It is easy to show that only one of them places the reconstructed points in front of the two cameras (see problems). It is found by reconstructing one point and picking the solution that gives it negative depths relative to both cameras.
