# Chapter 8. Structure from Motion

Known:  the projections of n points have been matched across m pictures
Target: using this information to estimate
* the 3d positions of the points in some fixed coordinate system (*Structure*)
* the projection matrices associated with the cameras observing them (apparant *motion* of the cameras relative to the points)

## 8.1 INTERNALLY CALIBRATED PERSPECTIVE CAMERAS

$$p_{ij} = \frac{1}{Z_{ij}}\begin{pmatrix}R_i&t_i\end{pmatrix}\binom{P_j}{1}$$

Known: m pictures, n points $P_j(j=1,...,n)$, correspondences established

*Euclidean SfM* Problem: estimate n vectors $P_j$ + m rotation matrices $R_i$ + translation vectors $t_i$

Analysis: 2mn constraints <=> 6m extrinsic parameters of the matrices $\mathit{M_i}$ and 3n parameters of the vectors $P_j$

So, take into account ambiguity of this problem, it admits a finite number of solutions as soon as:

$$2mn\geq6m+3n-7$$

For m = 2, five point should be OKAY.

**QUESTION:** why `2mn`, why `-7`

### 8.1.2 Euclidean Structure and Motion from Two Images

* Weak Calibration

* From Essential Matrix to Camera Motion

Aka, Essential Matrix $\large\varepsilon$ -> $R$ and $t$

We can have four numerical solutions,

> It is easy to show that only one of them places the reconstructed points in front of the two cameras (see problems). It is found by reconstructing one point and picking the solution that gives it negative depths relative to both cameras.


## 8.2 UNCALIBRATED WEAK-PERSPECTIVE CAMERAS

Camera intrinsic parameters are unknown.

$$p_{ij}=M_i\binom{P_j}{1}=A_iP_j+b_i, for i = 1,...,m and j = 1,...,n$$

where $M_i=\begin{pmatrix}A_i&b_i\end{pmatrix}$ is rank-2 2*4 matrix.

*Affine SfM* problem: estimate the m matrices $M_i$ and the n vectors $P_j$ from the mn image correspondences $p_{ij}$

Analysis: $2mn\geq8m+3n-12$, 12 comes from the fact that 12 parameters define a general affine transformation.

For m=2, n should be sufficient to determine the projection matrices and 3-d positions of the scene points.(Up to an affine transformation and possibly some discrete ambiguity)


To solve it:
a) first, use at least two view of the scene to reconstruct its 3-d affine shape and the corresponding projection matrices
b) use additional views and the constraints associated with known camera calibration parameters to uniquely determine the rigid Euclidean structure of the scene.
