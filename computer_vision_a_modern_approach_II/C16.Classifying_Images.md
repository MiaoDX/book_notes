# C16.Classifying Images

## 16.1 BUILDING GOOD IMAGE FEATURES

### 16.1.2 Encoding Layout with GIST Features

attempt to capture layout of different scenes

### 16.1.3 Summarizing Images with Visual Words

It is generally more important to know that something is present (the toaster in our example), than to know where it is.

So, we need something like a histogram, make it extreme:

Record characteristic local image patches: textons in texture or visual word in recognition, to make things clear:

* 1.Detect interest points and build neighborhoods around them
* 2.describe those neighborhoods with SIFT features
* 3.vector quantize these descriptions
* 4.build a representation of the overall pattern of vector-quantized neighborhoods

*Visual words* are obtained by vector quantizing neighborhoods.

### 16.1.4 The Spatial Pyramid Kernel

variant of a histogram of visual words that yields a kernel that has a very effective rough encoding of spatial layout.

It is notable that spatial pyramid kernels seem to represent relatively isolated objects or natural scenes well, but have trouble with textureless objects or objects that blend well into their backgrounds (Figure 16.10).
