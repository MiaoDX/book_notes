## 20.1 HMM’s, Dynamic Programming, and Tree-Structured Models

### 20.1.1 HMM Hidden Markov Models


## 20.2 PARSING PEOPLE IN IMAGES

A human parser:

* must produce some report of the configuration of the body in an image window
* offers cues to what the person is doing, by reporting where the arms, legs, and so on are.


## 20.3 TRACKING PEOPLE

### 20.3.1 Why human tracking is hard

balance of two kinds of evidence:

* direct measurements of state
    -  In the extreme case, if we can detect perfectly, building tracking systems isn’t that demanding (recent Learning approaches)
* predictable dynamics
    -  pool evidence over multiple frames and produce good state estimates even when measurements are poor
