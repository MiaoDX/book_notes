# C11.Tracking

## 11.1 SIMPLE TRACKING STRATEGIES

* tracking by detection
* tracking by matching

## 11.3 TRACKING LINEAR DYNAMICAL MODELS WITH KALMAN FILTERS

An important feature of linear dynamic models is that all the conditional probability distributions we need to deal with are normal distributions. 

There is a simple set of update rules known as the Kalman filter.

[Kalman filter, seems interesting and have seen this before, maybe try a demo]


## 11.4 DATA ASSOCIATION

The problem of determining which observations are informative and which are not is known as *data association*.
