# C19.Image-Based Modeling and Rendering

Image-based modeling and rendering:  Use prerecorded images of a scene to create a visual model supporting the synthesis of novel images of this scene.

* Visual hull: purely geometric
* Multi-View Stereopsis
* Light Field

## 19.1 Visual Hull

[MOSTLY SKIPED]

## 19.3 The Light Field

> a totally different approach to image-based modeling and rendering, that entirely forsakes the construction of a three-dimensional object model, yet is capable of synthesizing realistic new views of scenes with arbitrarily complex geometries.
