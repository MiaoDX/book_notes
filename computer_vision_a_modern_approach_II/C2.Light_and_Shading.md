# Chapter2. Light and Shading

## 2.1 Modelling pixel brightness

* Camera responses: the response of the camera to light
* Surface reflection: the fraction of light reflected from the surface to the camera

Diffuse reflection & specular reflection(Specularity)

* Illumination (光照强度): the amount of light falling on the surface

**Shading** inference


### 2.2.1 Radiometric Calibration and High Dynamic Range Images

The opencv have the implement of HDRI:

[Computational photography (photo module)](http://docs.opencv.org/master/d3/db7/tutorial_hdr_imaging.html)

[The python part](http://docs.opencv.org/master/d0/d07/tutorial_py_table_of_contents_photo.html)


## 2.4

**All this makes shape inference from shading in a single image one of the most
frustrating open questions in computer vision.**
